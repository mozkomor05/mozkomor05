# Briefly about me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @mozkomor05. Call me David :)
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, math, science and computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. Nothing long-term, rather short things that I come across. I'm particularly interested in machine learning.
- 💻 I work for [https://apertia.cz](https://apertia.cz). I primarily develop on the open source [EspoCRM](https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm) system. We implement it for larger companies and develop extensions to it. I have published some open-source versions of our extensions on my profile.
- 👨‍🎓 I'm a high school student.
